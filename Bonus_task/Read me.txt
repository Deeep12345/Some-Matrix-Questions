Yes, have worked with various sensor, actuators in many projects.
These are some project's, there are many more but I will have issue writing about
all of them. Please find Projects items here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ds_m6w_xxumnUz-OtCD75CCvjgollyMp?usp=sharing

1) Have made a 3 Axis Servo Arm
--> Built a robotic arm that could record data and perform certain tasks.
--> Was powered by Servos.
--> The controller was arduino.
--> Powered by li-po battery.

2) Have Made Home Automation Module
--> It has DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity sensor.
--> Had RTC clock for time saving.
--> Had option to interface with PIR sensor for motion detection.
--> Had it's own android application
--> Voice controlled via alexa and google home.
--> The cloud system was mqtt system, using amazon AWS cloud.

3) Made Earthquake BED
--> Was powered by Li-po batterys
--> The moving part was controlled by Stepper motors.
--> Had MPU6050 sensor, for sensing motion and earthquake.

4) Autonomous Bot
--> Autonomous line,wall following bot.
--> Had 8 IR sensors for following lines.
--> Had Encoder for measuring distance.
--> For wall following included 3 ultrasonic sensor.

5) Drone's 
--> Worked with Lidar sensor, MPU6050 and barometers
--> Very flight stability.
